            <h2>Block Level Elements</h2>
    
            <p>
              Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line 
              following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also 
              appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page.
               For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation 
               menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't 
              be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.
